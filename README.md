# buildGraph

The simple Matlab function for super easy graph building. You can use for building any graph or a number of graphs. Usually, I use it for labs in my university (:

This function provides an auto lines style, auto legend building, and all plots have the exactly right size you want to (at least close to good enough).

## buildGraphA
This is old version of function if you prefer an arguments rather than to use configuration structure.
